## priority-1-calendar

### Auto-Trigger Logic

Evaluate during the **scout step** (before full research). Priority order — highest wins. Only one special per week.

**Priority 1 — Calendar-Fixed Triggers (predictable, always fire)**

| Trigger | Format | When |
|---|---|---|
| Half-year mark | Rewind — "H1 in Review" | Last Sunday of June (defer if within 7 days of a trip — see trip-aware rules) |
| Year-end | Rewind — "The Year in Review" | Last Sunday of December |
| **Trip food guide (food-focused, always)** | **Field Guide** | ~6 weeks before an `upcoming_trips` entry with food-research value. **MANDATORY:** read § The Field Guide in full before any planning or writing — see the 14 headline rules at the top of that section. |
| Trip approaching | Countdown | 2-3 weeks before an `upcoming_trips` entry in state file |

**Priority 2 — Event-Driven Triggers (detected during research)**

| Trigger | Format | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| Serie A season concluded | Season Review — Serie A | Research finds final matchday results |
| Premier League season concluded | Season Review — Premier League | Research finds final matchday results |
| Major tournament concluded | Season Review — [Tournament] | Research finds final/closing ceremony |
| A major product launch this week | Deep Dive or Versus | Research finds a significant launch in a core interest (Switch 2, major game, new console, etc.) |
| Two competing products launched/announced close together | Versus | Research finds a natural head-to-head |

**Priority 3 — Editorial Picks (the safety net against dry spells)**

If no Priority 1 or 2 trigger has fired in the last 5 weeks, the editor picks a special from the pool below. These are evergreen — they don't depend on external events:

| Format | Example Topics |
|---|---|---|
| Guide (beginner mode) | Getting into Malazan, Specialty coffee from scratch, Fantasy Premier League for beginners, Home kettlebell training, Starting on Etsy |
| Guide (category mode) | A category roundup that hasn't been covered recently — boutique games, kettlebell drills, audio essay channels |
| Deep Dive | The history of a favourite game franchise, A deep look at a training methodology, The state of e-readers in 2026, Serie A tactical evolution |
| Versus | V60 vs AeroPress, Two fitness approaches, Two e-readers, Two budget tablets |

**The editorial picks pool ensures there's always a viable special available.** The editor selects the most timely or interesting option from the pool. Over time, used topics are tracked in the state file to avoid repeats.

**Manual-only format — Next.** Next never auto-triggers; it requires the reader to call it because it depends on specific context that only the reader holds.
- **Next** ("Run a Next — after [the thing you finished]") — needs the anchor: what the reader just finished. The magazine can't reliably detect "finished" status for podcasts/books/seasons from external signals.
- **Lookahead — RETIRED / FOLDED (v8.39, S2).** Formerly the second manual-only format; folded into the weekly's Release Radar + On the Radar (see § The Lookahead status marker). Do not run it. A reader asking "what's coming up over the next few weeks" is answered by the weekly's radar sections, not by a dedicated issue.

## guardrails

### Guardrails

- **Target frequency: one special every 4-6 weeks on average.** Not a hard rule, but if 6+ weeks pass without a special, Priority 3 must fire. If two natural triggers cluster in consecutive weeks, that's fine — but never three specials in a row.
- **Never more than 2 consecutive specials.** If two specials ran back-to-back, the next issue must be a standard weekly regardless of triggers.
- **The standard weekly is the backbone.** Specials are seasoning, not the main course. Most Sundays should be the standard weekly with rotating sections.
- **Manual triggers always override.** If the reader requests a specific format, that takes priority over any auto-trigger.
- **Track in state file:** `last_special_date`, `last_special_format`, `consecutive_specials_count`, `editorial_picks_used`.

## search-checklist

## Search Checklist

Run the **core groups** every issue. Run **rotating groups** only when that section is selected for the issue.

### Core Groups (every issue)

**Group 1 — News & Geopolitics:** dominant running story, world news. **UK / national politics is out by default** (see the UK / national politics rule in § Key Rules) — scan for it only to catch the rare genuine landscape shift (an election *result* that changes the picture, a government actually falling) and to surface a one-line safety-net mention of any big Westminster story in **Caught Up** (the issue's 8-line news-breadth digest — no longer a per-section Catch-Up job). **No story is auto-promoted to the Lead.** A UK-politics development — even a leadership challenge or a cabinet resignation — is *not* automatically a Lead-1 candidate (the v8.x auto-promote mandate was the direct engine of the Starmer ×3 run). It is covered like anything else, and it leads only if it passes the two-factor Lead test (§ Article Structure: did it move this week AND can we add the layer the daily couldn't). The news-breadth floor (Lens-not-Filter) still holds: a genuinely big world story always gets *covered*, in the Lead if it clears the test, otherwise as a Catch-Up line.

**Group 2a — Gaming (for Pixel & Byte, every issue):** Nintendo Switch 2, Steam Deck / Steam Machine, GeForce Now, high-quality tablet games, plus generalist gaming (the biggest game of the year gets covered even if it's not on Switch) — what came out this week + highlights of the next month + *new* rumours-with-analysis. LEGO news and releases (LEGO now lives in Pixel & Byte as an occasional "play" beat).

**Group 2b — Tech & tools (for The Toolkit, when it runs):** consumer tech (Pixel/Xiaomi/e-readers, wearables hardware as consumer news), consumer AI tools, Android apps / tablet productivity / workflows. The Toolkit yields when thin; when it runs, cover the full gap since its last appearance.

**Group 3 — Football & Sport:** First, check: are World Cup qualifiers, Euro qualifiers, World Cup finals, Euros, CL/EL knockout stages, or other major tournaments active this week? If yes, search for those first — they lead the section. Then search domestic (Juventus + Serie A, Premier League) only for significant news. If no tournament is active, search Serie A + Juventus, Premier League, CL/EL (in season), golf majors/Ryder Cup (when in season).

**Group 4 — Culture & Entertainment:** new movies and TV releases, Star Wars news, synthwave/retrowave/electronic music

**Group 5 — Fitness (for The Session):** running articles (race prep, 10k training, zone 2), gym/strength training (concurrent training, body recomposition, structured programming), kettlebell/StrongFirst/Dan John, mobility and recovery science, wearable/Garmin training data interpretation, nutrition for cutting while training

**Group 6 — Features & Evergreen (rotate):** gaming retrospectives, Reddit notable threads (r/NintendoSwitch, r/Juve, r/fantasybooks, r/kettlebell, r/running, r/fitness, r/StarWars, r/lego, r/Garmin), great long-reads from any era

**Images:** source via image search for every major section.
