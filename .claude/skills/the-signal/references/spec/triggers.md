## priority-1-calendar

### Auto-Trigger Logic

Evaluate during the **scout step** (before full research). Priority order — highest wins. Only one special per week.

**Priority 1 — Calendar-Fixed Triggers (predictable, always fire)**

| Trigger | Format | When |
|---|---|---|
| Half-year mark | Rewind — "H1 in Review" | Last Sunday of June (defer if within 7 days of a trip — see trip-aware rules) |
| Year-end | Rewind — "The Year in Review" | Last Sunday of December |
| **Trip food guide (food-focused, always)** | **Field Guide** | ~6 weeks before an `upcoming_trips` entry with food-research value. **MANDATORY:** read § The Field Guide in full before any planning or writing — see the 14 headline rules at the top of that section. |
| Trip approaching | Countdown | 2-3 weeks before an `upcoming_trips` entry in state file |

**Priority 2 — Event-Driven Triggers (detected during research)**

| Trigger | Format | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| Serie A season concluded | Season Review — Serie A | Research finds final matchday results |
| Premier League season concluded | Season Review — Premier League | Research finds final matchday results |
| Major tournament concluded | Season Review — [Tournament] | Research finds final/closing ceremony |
| A major product launch this week | Deep Dive or Versus | Research finds a significant launch in a core interest (Switch 2, major game, new console, etc.) |
| Two competing products launched/announced close together | Versus | Research finds a natural head-to-head |

**Priority 3 — Editorial Picks (the safety net against dry spells)**

If no Priority 1 or 2 trigger has fired in the last 5 weeks, the editor picks a special from the pool below. These are evergreen — they don't depend on external events:

| Format | Example Topics |
|---|---|---|
| Starter Kit | Getting into Malazan, Specialty coffee from scratch, Fantasy Premier League for beginners, Home kettlebell training, Starting on Etsy |
| Deep Dive | The history of a favourite game franchise, A deep look at a training methodology, The state of e-readers in 2026, Serie A tactical evolution |
| Versus | V60 vs AeroPress, Two fitness approaches, Two e-readers, Two budget tablets |
| Shortlist | A category roundup that hasn't been covered recently — boutique games, kettlebell drills, audio essay channels |

**The editorial picks pool ensures there's always a viable special available.** The editor selects the most timely or interesting option from the pool. Over time, used topics are tracked in the state file to avoid repeats.

**Manual-only formats — Next and Lookahead.** Two formats never auto-trigger; they require the reader to call them because they depend on specific context that only the reader holds.
- **Next** ("Run a Next — after [the thing you finished]") — needs the anchor: what the reader just finished. The magazine can't reliably detect "finished" status for podcasts/books/seasons from external signals.
- **Lookahead** ("Run a Lookahead — [window]") — needs the window: what stretch the reader wants surveyed. Default is 6-8 weeks; reader can shorten ("the next ten days") or lengthen ("the rest of the quarter").

## guardrails

### Guardrails

- **Target frequency: one special every 4-6 weeks on average.** Not a hard rule, but if 6+ weeks pass without a special, Priority 3 must fire. If two natural triggers cluster in consecutive weeks, that's fine — but never three specials in a row.
- **Never more than 2 consecutive specials.** If two specials ran back-to-back, the next issue must be a standard weekly regardless of triggers.
- **The standard weekly is the backbone.** Specials are seasoning, not the main course. Most Sundays should be the standard weekly with rotating sections.
- **Manual triggers always override.** If the reader requests a specific format, that takes priority over any auto-trigger.
- **Track in state file:** `last_special_date`, `last_special_format`, `consecutive_specials_count`, `editorial_picks_used`.

## search-checklist

## Search Checklist

Run the **core groups** every issue. Run **rotating groups** only when that section is selected for the issue.

### Core Groups (every issue)

**Group 1 — News & Geopolitics:** dominant running story, world news, UK / national politics, NI news briefly. Within this group, the scout phase MUST explicitly check for: (a) any UK / Irish / Scottish / Welsh / European elections held in the past 7 days (general, devolved, council aggregate); (b) live PM or opposition-leader leadership challenges (MPs calling for resignation, named challengers emerging, union pressure); (c) Cabinet-level resignations or sackings; (d) major government policy events (Budget, headline legal rulings, immigration policy changes). If any of (a)-(d) fired in the last 7 days, that story is automatically a candidate for Lead 1 unless an even bigger world story crowds it out. See the UK / national politics rule in this spec for the full Lead-grade vs parish-pump test.

**Group 2 — Tech & Gaming:** Nintendo Switch 2, Steam Deck, GeForce Now, consumer AI tools, Pixel/Xiaomi/e-readers, LEGO news and releases, gaming news and releases

**Group 3 — Football & Sport:** First, check: are World Cup qualifiers, Euro qualifiers, World Cup finals, Euros, CL/EL knockout stages, or other major tournaments active this week? If yes, search for those first — they lead the section. Then search domestic (Juventus + Serie A, Premier League) only for significant news. If no tournament is active, search Serie A + Juventus, Premier League, CL/EL (in season), golf majors/Ryder Cup (when in season).

**Group 4 — Culture & Entertainment:** new movies and TV releases, Star Wars news, synthwave/retrowave/electronic music

**Group 5 — Fitness (for The Session):** running articles (race prep, 10k training, zone 2), gym/strength training (concurrent training, body recomposition, structured programming), kettlebell/StrongFirst/Dan John, mobility and recovery science, wearable/Garmin training data interpretation, nutrition for cutting while training

**Group 6 — Features & Evergreen (rotate):** gaming retrospectives, Reddit notable threads (r/NintendoSwitch, r/Juve, r/fantasybooks, r/kettlebell, r/running, r/fitness, r/StarWars, r/lego, r/Garmin), great long-reads from any era

**Images:** source via image search for every major section.

### Rotating Groups

Search groups for rotating sections are in `references/sections.md`. Only search the groups for sections appearing in this issue.
